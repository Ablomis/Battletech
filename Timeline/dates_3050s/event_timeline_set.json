Small periphery realms disappeared from contact and mercenary units were annihilated (including a detachment from the elite Kell Hounds). In March of 3050, the invaders struck at the Inner Sphere proper. The invaders, known as the Clans, cut a swathe through the Lyran half of the Federated Commonwealth and Draconis Combine and absolutely devastated the Free Rasalhague Republic. Using their technological superiority and impressive combat prowess, over a hundred planets fell in the first year. Four Clans rolled into the Inner Sphere that year. Clans Wolf, Jade Falcon, Smoke Jaguar, and Ghost Bear. While some counterattacks succeeded, they failed to stop their advance.\n\n-- sarna.net",

They call for a peace summit to try and unify the Innersphere more strongly against the clan aggression. Such overtures are, however, rebuffed.  Largely due to the depth and complexity of their prior clandestine behaviour. Meanwhile, technological development continues at a staggering rate. Clan tech is now much more readily being rushed from the front lines into the arms of awaiting house scientists, who develop the soon to be iconic Bushwacker Battlemech.",
