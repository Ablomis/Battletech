After over a hundred years of grinding, low-intensity warfare and slow technological decay, the major states of the Inner Sphere have taken a brief pause. After Archon Katrina Steiner's peace proposal in 3020, the Lyran Commonwealth and the Federated Suns sign the Federated Commonwealth Alliance Document in 3022. In response, the Capellan Confederation, Draconis Combine and Free Worlds League sign the Kapteyn accords. While open conflict is limited, there is, of course, plenty of work for a mercenary company as the Successor Lords watch each other warily across their borders, waiting for a sign of weakness and a chance to gain the upper hand.",

The Lyran Commonwealth captured a stunning 53 planets from the Draconis Combine, but, shortly after, ComStar negotiated a settlement with the Draconis Combine that ceded most of those worlds to create the Free Rasalhague Republic. Now, an alliance of House Davion and House Steiner is poised to strike against the Draconis combine in hopes of repeating their successes against the Capellan Confederation. Little do they know, that the coiled Dragon has received vintage Star League-era technology gifts from ComStar which would surely affect the outcome.",
